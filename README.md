# IBL_Velocity_Scaling
 Repository with three datasets to conduct an analysis on scaling mean velocity and velocity defect profiles for turbulent flows with roughness transitions.

Switch to 'Release-Branch' branch when downloading the code so Figures directory is not included in the download (unless you want ALL the Figures ever generated)
